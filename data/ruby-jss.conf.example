#
#     ruby-jss configuration.
#
# This file should be stored at /etc/ruby-jss.conf
# on all machines that use ruby-jss
#
# A personal copy can also be stored in your home folder as
# ~/.ruby-jss.conf  and the settings there will override those
# from the system-wide file in /etc.
#
# When the JSS module is loaded, the conf files are read into
# an instance of JSS::Configuration, and stored in the constant JSS::CONFIG
#
# The values loaded are used by default for making API and database connections.
# However, they can be overridden per-connection by specifying values when
# calling the #connect methods.
#
# The file format is one attribute per line, thus:
#
#     attr_name: value
#
# Lines that don't start with a known attribute name followed by a colon
# are ignored. If an attribute is defined more than once, the last one wins.
#
# Known attributes are listed and defined in the ruby-jss.conf.default file
# in the rubygem folder's data folder
# (e.g. /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/ruby-jss-0.6.3/data/ruby-jss.conf.default )
#
# The conf file may be edited with any text editor, however developers should
# look at the manipulation methods in the JSS::Configuration class.
