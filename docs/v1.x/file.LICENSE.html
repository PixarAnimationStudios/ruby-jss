For the purposes<br/>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/><br/>      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br/>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br/>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br/>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br/>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br/>      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/><br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/><br/>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/><br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/><br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor<br/>      and its affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of<br/>      the License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</div></div>
