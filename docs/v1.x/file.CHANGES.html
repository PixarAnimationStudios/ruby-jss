<h2 id="important-known-security-issue-in-v153-and-below"><strong>IMPORTANT: Known Security Issue in v1.5.3 and below</strong></h2>

<p>Versions of ruby-jss prior to 1.6.0 contain a known security issue due to the use of the ‘plist’ gem.</p>

<p>This has been resolved in 1.6.0, which now uses the CFProperlyList gem.</p>

<p>Please update all installations of ruby-jss to at least v1.6.0.</p>

<p>Many many thanks to actae0n of Blacksun Hackers Club for reporting this issue and providing examples of how it could be exploited.</p>

<h2 id="section">[1.6.4] - 2021-10-04</h2>

<h3 id="fixed">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Removed erroneous call to generate self-service XML from JSS::RestrictedSoftware#rest_xml, restricted software items in Jamf Pro are not ‘self servable’. Thanks to @marekluban for catching and reporting this one!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="added">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Attribute reader JSS::Computer#security, returning the hash of data from the ‘security’ subset of API computer data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-1">[1.6.3] - 2021-09-13</h2>

<h3 id="fixed-1">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where some Jamf Pro API CollectionResource subclasses could not be fetched twice without a ‘.all’ scache refresh</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DBConnection.valid_server? connection timeout raised to 60 seconds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update JSS.expand_min_os to handle the fact that OS versions from Apple now have three meaningful parts (major.minor.patch) and that the patch version might be an ‘x’, as well as the minor version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-2">[1.6.1] - 2021-07-27</h2>

<h3 id="fixed-2">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Resolved some more typo-errors regarding display names in the SelfServable mixin module.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-1">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MySQL connections via the DBConnection class now report some authentication errors more clearly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-3">[1.6.0] - 2021-05-24</h2>

<h3 id="fixed-3">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Creating a JSS::User no longer requires a valid LDAP server. Many thanks to @aaron-mmt for filing and fixing this issue!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HTTP 409 errors are handled more appropriately, and should report the actual error message from the server, e.g. ‘Duplicate Primary MAC Address’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-2">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ruby-jss no longer uses the ‘plist’ gem due to a remote code execution security issue when using <code>Plist.parse_xml</code>. Plists are now handled by the CFPropertyList gem.  The existing wrapper method <code>JSS.parse_plist</code> bas been updated to use the new gem, and a new wrapper method has been added to convert ruby data to XML plist: <code>JSS.xml_plist_from(data)</code>. All internal references to methods from the insecure ‘plist’ gem have been replaced with calls to those wrapper methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many many thanks to actae0n of Blacksun Hackers Club for reporting this security issue and providing examples of how it could be exploited.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In preparation for the removal of the ‘runScript’ command in the jamf binary, JSS::Script no longer uses it within the ‘run’ instance method. Instead, it just does what the jamf binary did: It creates a private temp folder, writes the script to disk in that temp folder, executes the script with any given params, then deletes the folder, returning the exit status and output from the script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jamf::Script#run now takes parameters in the named params <code>p4:</code> through <code>p11:</code> for consistency with other parts of ruby-jss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since Jamf Scripts can no longer be stored in a distribution point, which according to Jamf has been the case for a while, all code for dealing with them that way has been removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::NetworkSegment#include? now uses Range#cover? under the hood, rather than Range#include?, which can take a very very long time with large segments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS.expand_min_os has been updated to handle Apple’s new version numbers for macOS. This method takes a string like ‘&gt;=10.14.3’ and expands it into a large array of greater OS versions and is used by the ‘os_limitations’ method of Packages and Scripts.  For any range of versions that includes Big Sur, both ‘11.x.x’ and ‘10.16’ as included in the output, to catch machines that may have SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT set in their env.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-4">[1.5.3] - 2020-12-28</h2>

<h3 id="fixed-4">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Classic API connections were not setting their default timeouts properly when first connected. This was causing an error in Policy#flush_logs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-5">[1.5.2] - 2020-12-21</h2>

<h3 id="added-1">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Policy#flush_logs can now be called as a class method JSS::Policy.flush_logs, passing in the policy names or ids, without instantiating the policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the class and instance ‘flush_logs’ methods for JSS::Policy take a named parameter ‘computers:’ which is an array of the computer identifiers for which the policy should be flushed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Computer instances now have a ‘flush_policy_logs’ method which is a wrapper for calling JSS::Policy.flush_logs for just that computer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::ConfigurationProfile: #update/#save now takes boolean param redeploy_to_all: which defaults to false. The default means redeploy only to newly assigned machines in scope. Setting this to true will push the profile out to all machines in scope, even if they already have the profile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-3">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS.expand_min_os, used to expand strings like ‘&gt;=10.14.5’ into comma-separated versions to be used in Package and Script os_limitations, has been updated to handle Big Sur being both 10.16 and 11.0, and for future OSes to be 12.x, 13.x etc.
  NOTE: If you’ve used this feature in the past, you might want to look at your package and script seetings and update them, since they will refer to OSes 10.17 and higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::APIConnection: initialize @object_list_cache as an empty hash. This provides more useful error messages when forgetting to pass non-default connection objects, and the default one is unused.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-5">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Scopable::Scope#remove_target and #remove_limitation didn’t always remove the item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Scopable::Scope: when calling the API for any reason, we now pass in the .api connection of the container. Not doing so when using a non-default connection object would cause problems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-6">[1.5.1] - 2020-11-16</h2>

<p>IMPORTANT: New minimum require ruby version is 2.3.0</p>

<p>Big thanks to @cybertunnel for many enhancements and fixes.</p>

<h3 id="added-2">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The .all method for subclasses of Jamf::CollectionResource now fully supports server-side paging, sorting and filtering (for endpoints that support RSQL filters). See the docs/comments for Jamf::CollectionResource.all for details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::ConfigurationProfile subclasses now have a #payload_content=(new_content) method, which takes an Array of Hashes to replace the PayloadContent of the Payload of the profile. All converstion to an XML plist (which is then embedded into the API XML) is handled automatically. WARNING: This is experimental and can easily break your profile if you aren’t careful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Server#update_activation_code method was added</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Group#set_static and #set_smart can convert smart groups to static and static to smart</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-4">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Minimum required ruby version is 2.3.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The JSS Module now uses the faraday gem, rather than rest-client, as the underlying REST/HTTP engine for communicating with the Classic API. This brings it in line with the Jamf module which has always used faraday for connecting to the Jamf Pro API. Faraday has fewer dependencies, none of which need to be compiled. This means that installing ruby-jss on a Mac no longer requires the XCode command-line tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The Jamf module, for accessing the Jamf Pro API, now requires Jamf Pro 10.25 or higher. While still in ‘beta’, the Jamf Pro API is becoming more stable and in compliance with standards. The Jamf module continues to be updated to work with the modernized endpoints of the JP API. Some related changes:
    <ul>
      <li>The ids of JP API collection objects are Strings containing Integers.</li>
      <li>Boolean property names no longer start with ‘is’, tho aliases ending with ‘?’ are still automatically created.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removed dependency on net-ldap, which hasn’t been used in a while</p>
  </li>
  <li>Removed the redundant JSS::APIConnection instance methods that were just wrappers for various APIObject subclass Class methods, e.g. <code>JSS.api.valid_id :computers, 'compName'</code>. Please use the class method directly, e.g. <code>JSS::Computer.valid_id 'compName'</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-6">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PatchSource.fetch was totally broken, now fixed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Category object’s parse_category not properly referencing API object during execution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many small bugs and typos.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-7">[1.4.1] - 2020-10-01</h2>

<h3 id="added-3">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for JP API connections to https://tryitout.jamfcloud.com/, the open API test server provided by Jamf. It uses internal tokens, so the /auth endpoint is disabled. Now as with the Classic API, <code>Jamf::Connection.connect</code>  will accpt any name &amp; password when connecting to that host.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-8">[1.4.0] - 2020-09-14</h2>

<h3 id="added-4">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Class JSS::VPPAccount, implementing the ‘vppacconts’ endpoint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constant JSS::APP_STORE_COUNTRY_CODES, a Hash with keys being the official country names used by the App Store, and values being the two-letter codes for those names. This static Hash is derived from a Jamf Pro API end point, and will be updated as needed. These codes are used by JSS::VPPAccount</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Module Method JSS.country_code_match(str) whic allows you to filter the JSS::APP_STORE_COUNTRY_CODES Hash to only those key-value pairs that include the given string.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mixin Class Method VPPable.all_vpp_device_assignable, returns a Hash of Hashes showing the total, used, and remaining licenses for all members of the target class that are VPP-assignable by device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scopable::Scope#in_scope?(machine) Given a JSS::Computer or MobileDevice, or an identifier for one, it is in the scope? WARNING: For scopes that include Jamf Users or User Groups as targets or exclusions, this method may return an incorrect value. See the discussion in the comments/documentation for the Scopable::Scope class under <code>IMPORTANT - Users &amp; User Groups in Targets and Exclusions</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scopable::Scope#scoped_machines returns a Hash of ids=&gt;names for all machines in this scope. WARNING:  This must instantiate all machines in the target class. It will still be slow, at least the first time for each target class. On the upside, the instantiated machines will be cached, so generating this list for other scopes with the same target class will be much much faster. In tests, with 1600 Computers in the JSS, it took about 7 minutes the first time, but less than 1 second after caching.
  See also the warning for #in_scope? above, which applies here as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Policy objects support ‘Policy Retry’ via the getter/setter methods #retry_event, #retry_attempts, and #notify_failed_retries. You can only set these values if the #frequency is :once_per_computer. To turn off policy-retry, either set the retry_event to :none, or set the retry_attempts to 0</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-5">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prettier XML for JSS::APIObject#ppx</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved JSS::Validate.boolean. Accepts: true, false, ‘true’, ‘false’, ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘t’,’f’, ‘y’, or ‘n’ as Strings or Symbols, case insensitive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The JSS::MacApplication class is more fully implemented</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Scopable::Scope now uses the word ‘targets’ consistently to match the UI’s ‘Targets’ tab.  The previous word ‘inclusions’ still works as before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When using the Jamf module to access the Jamf Pro API, the minumum JamfPro version is now 10.23.0. WARNING: Like the Jamf Pro API itself, the Jamf module that accesses it is in beta and may have breaking changes at any time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-7">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::ExtensionAttribute: when used as a display field in an AdvancedSearch, the name of the EA in the search result Hash comes from the API as a String (turned into a Symbol) that is the EA name with colons removed and spaces &amp; dashes turned to underscores. Previously ruby-jss didn’t remove the colons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Used an XML workaround for the common classic API bug where an XML array comes as a single-item JSON hash. This time in the JSS::User class’s user_groups method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Jamf Pro API endpoints for /v1/device-enrollment changed to /v1/device-enrollments and /v1/device-enrollment/sync/<id> changed to /v1/device-enrollments/<id>/syncs.  /v1/devive-enrollments/syncs.</id></id></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Jamf Pro API endpoint for bulk-deleting Departments changed from ‘delete-departments’ to ‘delete-multiple’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-9">[1.3.3] - 2020-08-07</h2>

<h3 id="fixed-8">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Regression where JSS::Package#required_processor= wouldn’t take ‘x86’</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-10">[1.3.2] - 2020-07-31</h2>
<p>Many thanks to @cybertunnel for adding a huge amount of code to get JSS::Policy fully implimented, as well as other fixes and updates!</p>

<h3 id="added-5">Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>new class JSS::DockItem</li>
  <li>new classes JSS::DirectoryBinding and JSS::DirectoryBindingType</li>
  <li>new class JSS::Printer</li>
  <li>new class JSS::DiskEncryptionConfiguration</li>

      <li><code>#reissue_key</code>, <code>#apply_encryption_configuration</code>, and <code>#remove_encryption_configuration</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-6">Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JSS::Package:
    <ul>
      <li>no longer issues a warning when changing the file_name of a package</li>
      <li>Updated the CPU type string from ‘x86’ to ‘Intel/x86’</li>
      <li>Methods which used to always use the master distribution point now accept a parameter <code>dist_point: dp</code> where dp is the name or id of a fileshare distribution point. If not specified, it still defaults to the Master Distribution Point.  This is needed because if the Cloud Distribution Point is the master, there is no access to it via the Classic API, and any use of DistributionPoint.master_distribution_point will raise an error.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-11">[1.3.1] - 2020-06-21</h2>

<h3 id="changed-7">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::MobileDeviceApplication when using PrettyPrint (pp) in irb, no longer shows the base64 data for the ipa file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::DistributionPoint.my_distribution_point and .master_distribution_point now have options for dealing with the Cloud Distribution Point (which is not available in the classic API) being the master.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-9">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>JSS::NetworkSegment.distribution_point=  now takes nil or an empty string to unset the dist point.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-12">[1.3.0] - 2020-06-05</h2>

<h3 id="added-6">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::NetworkSegment.network_ranges_as_integers method, Similar to NetworkSegment.network_ranges, but the ranges are of Integers, not IPAddr instances. This makes for <em>MUCH</em> faster range calculations, needed to implement improvements to NetworkSegment.network_segment_for_ip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Package.all_filenames_by, returns a Hash of all distribution point filenames for all packages, keyed by either the package id, or the package name. NOTE: as with JSS::Package.all_filenames, this method must instantiate all JSS::Package objects, so it will be slow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-8">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS.expand_min_os now expands to macOS 10.30.x, which should hold us for a while</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::NetworkSegment.network_segment_for_ip and .my_network_segment are no longer deprecated, but now return an integer NetSeg id (or nil). The plural forms of those methods still return an Array of ids for all the matching network segments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The logic for JSS::NetworkSegment.network_segment_for_ip (and .my_network_segment) now matches how the Jamf server does it:  when you IP address is in more than one Network Segment, Jamf uses the smallest/narrowest one (the one containing fewest IP addresses). If more than one of your Network Segments are that same width, the one with the lowest starting IP address is used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some networking situations (e.g. Split-tunnel VPN with multiple active network ports) the JSS::APIObject.delete method will raise a 404 NotFound error, seemingly because the object was already deleted but a second http DELETE is sent (I think). We now just rescue and ignore that error, since the fact that it’s not found means it was indeed deleted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-10">Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A copy/paste bug in Jamf::Prestage.serials_for_prestage</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="added-8">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Computer#reported_ip_address. This value is collected in newer versions of Jamf Pro. While the #ip_address is the client’s IP address from the Jamf Server’s perspective, the #reported_ip_address is the IP from the client’s perspective, which may be different on a NATted network like a home network.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>MobileDevice#upload now works like Computer#upload</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="section-18">[1.2.9] - 2020-04-13</h2>

<h3 id="fixed-15">Fixed</h3>

</ul>

<h2 id="section-19">[1.2.8] - 2020-04-12</h2>

<h3 id="added-9">Added</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MobileDevice#update now takes the <code>no_mdm_rename:</code> boolean parameter. Prevents an MDM rename command being sent when changing the name of a supervised device with enforced names. Useful when the MDM command fails, as when there’s already a pending rename command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>String#jss_float?</code> and <code>String#j_float?</code> predicate methods.</p>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>‘Beta’ Jamf Pro API support in ruby-jss!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The Jamf Pro API, formerly known as the ‘Universal’ API, aims to be a far more robust, modern, and standardized way to programmatically access a Jamf Pro server.  While its been in development for a while, it is finally starting to settle in to some standards, to the point that its worth releasing some early ruby-jss code to access it.</p>

<p>Because the JP-API is so fundamentally different from the Classic API, it’s being implemented as a totally separate ruby module ‘Jamf’, and many of the underlying standards of ruby-jss’s JSS module are being re-thought and modernized, much like the JP-API itself. Classic API access using the JSS module is unchanged, and will continue to get fixes and other updates as needed. However many things in the Jamf module will behave differently from the JSS module, at least in detail if not concept.</p>

<p>For requirements and details of using the Jamf module to access the Jamf Pro API, see <a href="lib/jamf/README-JP-API.md">lib/jamf/README-JP-API.md</a>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> As with the JP-API, The Jamf module is an early work-in-progress, and things might change drastically at any point. Please mention ‘ruby-jss’ in MacAdmins Slack channels #jamf-api or #ruby, or email ruby-jss@pixar.com, or open an issue on github if you have questions or want to contribute.</p>

<h3 id="changed-13">Changed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>last_mdm_contact</code> class and instance method from the MDM mixin module (as used in Computer and MobileDevice classes) now returns the time of the most recent <em>completed</em> or <em>failed</em> mdm command. This is more accurate than just the completed commands, since a failed command still implies contact between the client and Jamf Pro.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::MobileDevice instances now have three predicate methods: <code>tv?</code> (aliased as <code>apple_tv?</code>), <code>ipad?</code> and <code>iphone?</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-24">[1.2.3] - 2019-10-31</h2>
<p>### Added
- the ManagementHistory mixin module used by the Computer and MobileDevice classes, now has a <code>last_mdm_contact</code> class and instance method, which returns a Time object for the timestamp of the most recent completed MDM command. This is useful for MobileDevices, which don’t have anything like the <code>last_checkin</code> value for comptuers, indicating real communication between the device and Jamf Pro.
Note that the <code>last_inventory_update</code> value does NOT indicate such communication, since that timestamp is updated when values are changed via the API</p>

<ul>
  <li>All APIObject Subclasses (Policy, Computer, MobileDevice, ComputerGroup, etc..) now have <code>get_raw</code>, <code>post_raw</code> &amp; <code>put_raw</code> class methods, which are simpler wrappers for APIConnection#get_rsrc, #post_rsrc, and #put_rsrc.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>get_raw</code>  takes an object’s id, and returns the ‘raw’ JSON (parsed into a ruby Hash with symbolized keys) or a REXML::Document (from which you’ll probably want to use the <code>root</code> element). If you pass <code>as_string: true</code> you’ll get the un-parsed JSON or XML string directly from the API
This can be useful when you need to retrieve the full object, to get some data not available in the summary-list, but instantiating the full ruby class is too slow</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>post_raw</code> &amp; <code>put_raw</code> can send raw XML to the API without instantiating objects. In some cases, where you’re making simple changes to simple XML, this can be faster than fetching a full instance and the re-saving it.
WARNING You must create or acquire the XML to be sent, and no validation will be performed on it. It must be a String of XML, or something that returns such a string with #to_s, such as a REXML::Document, or a REXML::Element.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>APIConnection#get_rsrc now takes the boolean raw_json: parameter (defaults to false). If true, the raw JSON string is
returned, not parsed into a Hash. When requesting XML, it already comes as a string.</p>
  </li>
  <li>ExtensionAttribute#attribute_mapping getter &amp; setter for EAs that have the ‘LDAP Attribute Mapping’ input type.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="section-25">[1.2.0] - 2019-10-17</h2>
<p>### Added
- APIConnection#flushcache can be used to flush all cached data, or just for specific APIObject lists or ExtensionAttribute definitions. This is now used more often throughout ruby-jss.</p>

<h3 id="fixed-19">Fixed</h3>

  <li>
    <p>APIConnection#connect now flushes all cached data, so if you use it to change which server is being used by an existing connection, you don’t keep the cached data from the old server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PatchPolicy now overrides APIObject.fetch to still allow for fetching by name, even there’s no patchpolicies/name/… endpoint</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-15">Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Group#create with <code>calculate_members: true</code>, will sometimes try to re-read the new group before the JSS knows it exists, causing a <code>404 Not Found</code> error.  This is especially common when using a clustered environment behind a load-balanced hostname (like <em>something.jamfcloud.com</em>).
Now, if a 404 happens when trying to refresh the membership using calculate_members, ruby-jss will retry every second for up to 10 seconds.
To change the number of retries, provide an integer with the <code>retries:</code> parameter. If you don’t need to know the group members after creation, pass <code>calculate_members: false</code> when calling Group#create or Group#save</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating, Updating, or Deleting objects of the APIObject subclasses now flushes the cached <code>all</code> lists for that class, so subseqent uses of the <code>all</code> lists will refresh the data from the API. This means that <code>APIObject.valid_id</code> will work immediately upon object creation. NOTE: However, when using a clustered environment behind a load-balanced hostname (like jamfcloud.com), it may take some time for the <code>all</code> list to update on all nodes of the cluster, so you might still need to pause up to the number of seconds defined of the cluster’s sync interval to ensure valid lists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case-insentive lookup &amp; validation methods in APIObject now use <code>String#casecmp?</code> for much simpler code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creatable#create no longer takes an <code>api:</code> parameter (it never should have) The API connection given in #make is always used for creating the object in the API.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The JSS::APIConnection.connect method, used for making all classic API connections, now takes a <code>server_path:</code> parameter.
If your JSS is not at the root of the server, e.g. if it’s at
  <code>https://myjss.myserver.edu:8443/dev_mgmt/jssweb/</code>
rather than
  <code>https://myjss.myserver.edu:8443/</code>

      <li>New Class Method
        <ul>
          <li><code>JSS::Package.calculate_checksum(filepath, type)</code> calcuates an MD5 or SHA_512 hash for an arbtrary file.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>New Instance Methods:
        <ul>
          <li><code>JSS::Package#caluclate_checksum(type: nil, local_file: nil, rw_pw: nil, ro_pw: nil, unmount: true )</code> recalculates and returns the checksum from a local file or the master dist. point. Doesn’t change the Package instance</li>
          <li><code>JSS::Package#checksum_valid?(local_file: nil, rw_pw: nil, ro_pw: nil, unmount: true)</code> recalculates the checksum from a local file or the master dist. point, and returns Boolean true if it matches the stored one, false if not. Always false if there is no stored checksum. Doesn’t change the Package instance</li>
          <li><code>JSS::Package#reset_checksum(type: nil, local_file: nil,  rw_pw: nil, ro_pw: nil, unmount: true)</code> recalculates and resets the checksum from a local file or the master dist. point. The instance must be saved back to the server for the new checksum to stick,</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Modified Instance Method
        <ul>
          <li><code>JSS::Package#upload_master_file</code> now takes a <code>cksum:</code> parameter, the String ‘MD5’ or ‘SHA_512’. Any other value means ‘don’t use a checksum on this package’ Defaults to ‘SHA_512’ and a checksum will be calculated. Be sure to set <code>cksum:</code> to some other value if you don’t want a checksum.</li>

    <p>defaults to using TLSv1.2 for API connections.</p>

    <p>As of Jamf Pro 10.5. the server requires TLSv1.2 and will not accept connections using TLSv1.</p>

    <p><strong>COMPATIBILITY:</strong></p>

    <p>MacOS 10.12 and lower have an old version of the openssl library which used by the built-in ruby (/usr/bin/ruby), which does not support TLSv1.2.</p>

    <p>If you are using macOS 10.12 or lower to connect to Jamf Pro 10.4 (the lowest Jamf server supported by this version of ruby-jss), you must specify the older TLS when using APIConnection#connect, e.g.</p>

    <p><code>JSS.api.connect server: 'myjss.myschool.edu', user: 'username', pw: :prompt, ssl_version: :TLSv1</code></p>

    <p>Machines running macOS 10.12 or lower will not be able to connect to Jamf Pro &gt; v10.4 with the built-in ruby openssl library. If you specify <code>ssl_version: :TLSv1</code> you will get an error because the server won’t accept it. If you leave the default :TLSv1_2, ruby’s openssl library will complain that it doesn’t know about that.</p>

    <p>If you have 10.12 or older machines that must connect to newer Jamf Pro servers with ruby-jss, there are a few options.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>upgade the machines to 10.13 or higher</li>
      <li>install a newer openssl, then install a your own ruby using that openssl (both can be done with homebrew)</li>
      <li>do the above, then extract the openssl library and modify it to work with the built-in ruby.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>
    <p>JSS::PatchTitle, which also gives access to the patchreports endpoint. Also uses the JSS::PatchTitle::Version class to handle patch versions within a title, and assign packages to them. <strong>WARNING</strong>: ruby-jss will not allow duplicate ‘display names’ (the #name of the JSS::PatchTitle instance) - but the Jamf Web UI will allow duplicates. If you have duplicates, and retrieve PatchTitles by name, which one gets returned to you is undefined.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The ‘source_id’ and ‘name_id’ of a patch title are, when combined, a unique identifier in the JSS (i.e. name_id’s are unique within sources) As such, the PatchTitle.all list provides a :source_name_id key, which is a String made by joining the two values with a ‘-‘, e.g. ‘1-GoogleChrome’.  This value can be used as a lookup for .fetch, e.g. <code>JSS::PatchTitle.fetch source_name_id: '1-GoogleChrome'</code>. There is also a matching .all_source_name_ids method, and the .map_all_ids_to() method takes :source_name_id as a mapping parameter.

    <p>JSS::PatchPolicy. PatchPolicies are creatable when providing an active PatchTitle and an appropriate PatchTitle::Version that has a package assigned to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Group metaclass now has a calculate_members option (bool) to the #create method. When true, the membership of the group will be updated in the existing ruby instance immediately after the group is created in the JSS. Doesn’t do much for static groups, but is useful for smart groups. Defaults to true. If you don’t care about the membership immediately, or don’t want to wait for the membership to be calculated on the server, set this to false.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more generic data validation methods in JSS::Validate module, and more use of them throughout the code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘support’ in SelfServable for notifications - note that there are API bugs limiting the usefulness of this.</p>

  <li>
    <p>regex options to JSS::Criteriable::Criterion objects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is now a, sort-of, spec/testing framework. While based on ruby’s minitest specifications, it’s wrapped in a very custom executable with a helper module. See the README in the test directory for details.  Specs will be added slowly over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Client now has a .management_action class method, which wraps around the ‘Management Action.app’ tool that comes with Jamf Pro and creates Notification Center notifications. At the moment support is minimal, and the notification type (alert vs. banner) is up to the User.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="removed">Removed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the .new class method on APIObject subclasses no longer works. Even though it’s the standard ruby way to create instances of a class, <code>.new</code> for APIObjects was confusing, since it implied creating new objects in the JSS.  Instead you must now use the <code>.fetch</code> class method to instantiate existing objects and the <code>.make</code> class method to instantiate local instances of objects to be created in the JSS. Both .fetch and .make have existed for some time.</p>

    <p><strong>COMPATIBILITY:</strong></p>

    <p><code>existingcomp = JSS::Computer.new id: 1234</code> and <code>new_pol = JSS::Policy.new id: :new, name: 'mypolicy'</code> will now raise an error.</p>

    <p>Instead you must use <code>existingcomp = JSS::Computer.fetch id: 1234</code> and <code>new_pol = JSS::Policy.make name: 'mypolicy'</code></p>

    <p>Note that the instance methods <code>#create</code> (create the current instance as a new object in the JSS) and <code>#update</code> (send changes in the current instance to the JSS) remain unchanged, and both continue handled by <code>#save</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-31">[0.14.0] - 2018-05-30</h2>
<p>### Fixed
- RestClient no longer uses RestClient::Request::Unauthorized, only RestClient::Unauthorized</p>

<ul>
  <li>RestClient 2.0x doesn’t seem to play nicely with the version of openssl on macOS 10.10 and JamfPro 10.3 (at least in our environment). So the rest-client gem can be any version &gt;= 1.8.0 and &lt; 2.1. You may have to separately install the correct RestClient version as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-32">[0.13.0] - 2018-05-30</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Now augmenting ruby Hashes with an embeded ‘recursive-open-struct’ version of themselves. This simplifies accessing values from deeply-nested Hash structures, e.g. JSS::Computer#hardware instead of <code>computer_instance.hardware[:storage].first[:partition][:percentage_full]</code> you can do <code>computer_instance.hardware.jss_ros.storage.first.partition.percentage_full</code>.  See http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-jss/Hash for details. Uses the <a href="https://github.com/aetherknight/recursive-open-struct">recursive-open-struct gem</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section-34">[0.11.0] - 2018-03-12</h2>
<p>### Changed
- Updated general attributes for computers and mobile devices</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Computers and MobileDevices are now Creatable. Use the .make class method to create an unsaved instance, then .create/.save instance method to create the JSS record. Note: Mobile Devices need both a unique serial number and unique udid to be accepted by the API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handling of ‘site’ data is now done via the JSS::Sitable mixin module</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the JSS server’s hostname ends with ‘jamfcloud.com’ default to SSL port 443 (vs 8443 for locally hosted JSSs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>now requires net-ldap v 0.16, for security fixes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All handling of MDM commands is in the JSS::MDM module, which is mixed in to Computer, ComputerGroup, MobileDevice, and MobileDeviceGroup</p>

    <p><em>WARNING</em> Due to the expanded functionality of MDM commands overall, the syntax for calling .send_mdm_command may have changed, depening on how you used it. Please test your code before updating.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘devmode’, use <code>JSS.devmode \[:on|:off]</code><code> to set, and </code>JSS.devmode?`` to query.  Useful for developers, esp. in <code>irb</code> who want, e.g. to have a method output some state when in devmode, instead of/as well as behaving normally. This is currently the case for <code>JSS::MDM.send_mdm_command</code>.  When devmode? is true, the XML sent to the API for the command is printed to stdout before the command is sent to the target machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computer app usage &amp; mgmt data methods are now class methods, so can be used without instantiating the computer. The instance methods remain, and they now just use the class methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All handling of management history for Computers and MobileDevices is in the new ManagementHistory module. The module
is mixed into JSS::Computer and JSS::MobileDevice, so its methods are available to those classes and their instances. Note that some
history events are only available in Computers or MobileDevices, and some are available in both.</p>

    <p>The primary query method (.management_history) returns the raw JSON data from the API, possibly for a subset of the data, as a Ruby Hash
with symbolized keys. This data is somewhat inconsistent in its structure and content across the different types of history events,
but you’re welcome to use it if needed.</p>

    <p>All other methods now return Arrays of various instances of classes defined in the module.</p>

    <p>For example, the <span class='object_link'><a href="JSS/ManagementHistory.html#audit_history-instance_method" title="JSS::ManagementHistory#audit_history (method)">JSS::ManagementHistory#audit_history</a></span> method returns an Array of JSS::ManagementHistory::AuditEvent instances,  and the
<span class='object_link'><a href="JSS/ManagementHistory.html#completed_policies-instance_method" title="JSS::ManagementHistory#completed_policies (method)">JSS::ManagementHistory#completed_policies</a></span> gives an Array of JSS::ManagementHistory::PolicyLog objects. These objects are read-only and
provide access to their values via attribute-style methods, and hash-like keys, similar to how OpenStruct objects do.</p>

    <p>As with MDM command handling, and computer app usage and mgmt data, the work is done by class methods, so that the data is available without creating instances of the Computers or MobileDevices, and the instance methods just
call the class methods.</p>

    <p><em>WARNING</em> these changes mean that the methods returning Arrays of ManagementHistory class instances are not backward compatible,
since the earlier versions returned Hashes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scope objects use the api connection of their container</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deprecated">Deprecated</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The JSS::APIConnection convenience class methods .computer_history, .send_computer_mdm_command, and .send_computer_mdm_command.</p>

    <p>These methods have been updated to work with the new methods in the MDM and ManagementHistory modules, but will be removed from JSS::APIConnection in a future release. Instead, call them directly from the JSS::Computer or JSS::MobileDevice classes, passing in the desired APIConnection if needed. Given the expansion of MDM commands and history details, maintaining the convenience methods in APIConnection is too prone to errors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-35">[0.10.2] - 2018-02-16</h2>
<p>### Fixed
-  <em>IMPORTANT</em>: Updating JSS::Extendable objects with no changes to ext. attribs will no longer erase all ext attrib values. (!)</p>

<h2 id="section-36">[0.10.1] - 2017-11-08</h2>
<p>### Added
- Extension Attribute values that are populated by Script or LDAP can now be modified via Extendable#set_ext_attr.</p>

<p>Previously, attempts to set the value would raise an exception, because those values aren’t modifiable in the WebUI.
  However, the API itself allows such modification, so now ruby-jss does too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you have access to the JSS MySQL database, ruby-jss now provides acces to the ‘object history’ of all APIObject subclasses.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately there is no way to get at this data via the API, but if you can connect to the MySQL database (JSS::DB_CNX.connect)
then you can call <code>#object_history</code> and <code>#add_object_history_entry</code> for individual object instances.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-27">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Error when no storage device on a Computer is marked as the boot drive (Thanks @christopher.kemp!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-37">[0.10.0] - 2017-10-09</h2>
<p>### Changed
- Working with multiple APIConnections is now far more flexible!
  There are three ways to work with multiple simultaneous APIConnection instances:
    1. Making a connection ‘active’, after which API calls go thru it (introduced in 0.9.0)
    2. Passing an APIConnection instance to methods that use the API
    3. Using an APIConnection instance itself to make API calls.</p>

<p>The default/active connection continues to work as always, so your existing code will be fine.
  See the <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-jss/JSS/APIConnection">documentation for the JSS::APIConnection class</a> for details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improvement: Extendable module: only push changed EAs when <code>update</code> is called.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-28">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Specifying port 443, as well as 8443, when connecting an APIConnection will default to using SSL. To force such a connection to NOT use SSL, provide the parameter <code>use_ssl: false</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require ‘English’, rather than require ‘english’. Thanks to HIMANSHU-ELIGIBLE @ github for catching &amp; fixing this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Popup extension attributes can always take a blank value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UserGroup members have a ‘username’ value, not ‘name’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>APIConnection.map_all_ids wasn’t honoring :refresh</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="added-14">Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Two case-insentive string methods added to Array:
    <ul>
      <li>Array#jss_ci_include_string? Takes a string, returns true if the Array contains the string without regard to case.
    E.g. <code>['ThrAsHer'].jss_ci_include_string? 'thrasher' # =&gt; true</code></li>
      <li>Array#jss_ci_fetch_string Takes a string and fetches it from the array, regardless of case. Nil if not found.
    E.g. <code>['thrasher'].jss_ci_fetch_string 'ThrAsHer'  # =&gt; 'thrasher'</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Computer objects now have a <code>last_enrolled</code> attribute</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-38">[0.9.3] - 2017-08-08</h2>
<p>### Added
- JSS::Computer instance now allow you to modify mac_address, alt_mac_address, udid, and serial_number.
  Note: even tho the WebUI doesn’t allow editing of the serial_number, the API does and doing so can be useful
  for dealing with duplicate SN’s when a new logic board with a new udid creates a new computer entry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSS::Validate module, to consoliday generic data-validation methods. Methods will be moved to it from
other places over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-40">[0.9.0] - 2017-07-17</h2>
<p>### Changed
- JSS::RestrictedSoftware class is now Creatable and Updatable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>APIObject.fetch can be given a single value, which will be compared to the subclass’s .all_ids,
.all_names, and other list methods for the various lookup keys, and if a match is found, the object is returned. E.g. instead of
JSS::Computer.fetch name: ‘foo’  you can just use JSS::Computer.fetch ‘foo’.
Note that specifying the lookup key is always faster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS constants of APIObject subclasses can now reconize variations on a key, e.g. :serialnumber and
  :serial_number, or :macaddress and :mac_address</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for multiple APIConnection instances - you can connect to more than one server at a time and switch between them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>APIConnection connection settings come first from the #connect params, then from Configuration,
then from the Client setting (if the machine is a client), then from the module defaults</p>

<h2 id="section-50">[0.6.3] - 2016-03-09</h2>
<p>Maintenence version bump to fix an issue uploading to rubygems.org</p>

<h2 id="section-51">[0.6.2] - 2016-03-08</h2>
<p>As of v0.6.2, the github project, and rubygem have been renamed to ‘ruby-jss’. The ‘require’ name is now ‘jss’.</p>

<p>In part this was to make the name more in-line with other ruby gems, and also to get in line with Shea Craig’s <a href="https://github.com/sheagcraig/python-jss">python-jss</a> and Charles Edge’s <a href="https://github.com/krypted/swift-jss">swift-jss</a></p>

<p>Yes we now have native API access in 3 languages!</p>

<p>The ‘jss-api’ gem has been updated one last time, also to v0.6.2. That gem has a dependency on ruby-jss v0.6.2 or greater, and if you require ‘jss-api’ with it, it merely requires ‘jss’ for you.  While that will provide backward-compatibility, please update your code to require ‘jss’ directly, since the jss-api wrapper gem won’t be around forever.</p>

<h3 id="changed-19">Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Project &amp; gem name are now ‘ruby-jss’</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="added-20">Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Package#os_ok? and JSS::Package#processor_ok? methods can now check those things against the package settings, and not attempt to install if the machine isn’t up to snuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::ExtensionAttribute#latest_values always now includes :username in the returned data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed-35">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::stdin_lines no longer uses a constant to store incoming stdin data at load time, which causes hangs when there’s no terminal on stdin. Now stdin is only read when the method is called, and data stored in a module variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Composer::mk_dmg fix for building/indexing dmg’s, no longer creates an unreadable .Trashes folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several small typos and other tiny bugs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-52">[0.6.1] - 2016-03-01</h2>
<p>### Added
- JSS::Package#install now takes :alt_download_url argument.Can be used to specify a custom URL from which to download a pkg/dmg for installation with ‘jamf install’. This allows the use of cloud distribution points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSS::DistributionPoint: Added reachability methods, improved assessment of mount-success. #reachable_for_download? and #reachable_for_upload? will now return a boolean indicating if the DistPoint is reachable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-53">[0.6.0] - 2016-01-06</h2>
<p>This version of the jss-api gem incorporates changes needed for the upcoming release of d3 (a.k.a. depot3),
a package/patch management system for Casper, which was the reason for the jss-api gem to begin with.</p>

<p>As such, while the JSS module will continue to be a separate git repo, specific commits of it will be
submodules of the depot3 git repo, starting with this one, or one shortly hereafter.</p>

<h3 id="changed-20">Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Package#install now returns a boolean indicating success of installation.
 The previous return value (the Process::Status of the ‘jamf install’ proceess) usually returned 0 exitstatus even if the pkg install failed.
 Now the actual install command is examined, and if its exitstatus is zero, Package#install returns true, else false.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSS::Package: better handling of API values like “None” and “No category assigned”</p>
  </li>
