    # Return all results from a pageable list path.
    #
    # Pageable resources are always returned in pages, usually defaulting to
    # 100 items per page, but the max allowed page size is 2000. If there are more
    # than 2000 items, we must loop through the pages to get them all.
    #
    # This method is used to get all pages of data from a giving path, automatically
    # looping through the pages and collecting the data to be returned in a
    # single Array. It uses a Pager object to do that, but the Pager itself
    # is transient, only the resulting Array is returned.
    #

    #   query results
