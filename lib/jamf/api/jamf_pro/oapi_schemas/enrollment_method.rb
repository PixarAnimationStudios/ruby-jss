    # This class was automatically generated from the api/schema
    # URL path on a Jamf Pro server version 11.9.2-t1726753918
    #
    # This class may be used directly, e.g instances of other classes may
    # use instances of this class as one of their own properties/attributes.
    #
    # It may also be used as a superclass when implementing Jamf Pro API
    # Resources in ruby-jss. The subclasses include appropriate mixins, and
    # should expand on the basic functionality provided here.

    # Container Objects:
    # Other object models that use this model as the value in one
    # of their attributes.

    # Sub Objects:
    # Other object models used by this model's attributes.

    # Endpoints and Privileges:
    # API endpoints and HTTP operations that use this object
    # model, and the Jamf Pro privileges needed to access them.
