    # OAPI Object Model and Enums for: PolicyPropertiesV1
    #
    #
    #
    # This class was automatically genereated from the api/schema
    # URL path on a Jamf Pro server version 10.40.0-t1657115323
    #
    # This class may be used directly, e.g instances of other classes may
    # use instances of this class as one of their own properties/attributes.
    #
    # It may also be used as a superclass when implementing Jamf Pro API
    # Resources in ruby-jss. The subclasses include appropriate mixins, and
    # should expand on the basic functionality provided here.
    #
    #
    # Container Objects:
    # Other object models that use this model as the value in one
    # of their attributes.
    #  
    #
    # Sub Objects:
    # Other object models used by this model's attributes.
    #  
    #
    # Endpoints and Privileges:
    # API endpoints and HTTP operations that use this object
    # model, and the Jamf Pro privileges needed to access them.
    #  - '/v1/policy-properties:GET' needs permissions:
