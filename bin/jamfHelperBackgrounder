# == Synopsis
#   Run the jamfHelper program as a detached background process, optionally
#   writing its output to a file, and optionally running it as the console user
#   (if this script is being run by root).
#
#  WARNING: You shouldn't run this command directly as a launchd job. Rather
#  you should write a small script that runs this command, and use launchd
#  to run that.
#
#
# == Usage
#   jamfHelperBackgrounder <options> | -help

This command runs the jamfHelper command as a detached background process.
This means that you use this command in a policy (via script, usually) and the
Policy execution will continue, and exit properly, even while the jamfHelper window
is still open.

This is important because future Jamf checkins will not happen if an earlier checkin
policy is waiting for a jamfHelper window to close.

This command takes all the same commandline options as jamfHelper, plus these:

  -outputFile <path>      Write the numeric output from jamfHelper to the file
                          at <path>. The path must be writable by the user
                          running jamfHelper (see below).
                          This file can be examined later to determine what
                          the user clicked.

  -consoleUser            Run the jamfHelper process as the current console (GUI)
                          user. This is needed from most policies and other code
                          running as root, in order to show the window in the
                          current console user's UI. If no one is logged into the
                          console, nothing happens.
                          This can only be used by the root user.

  -help                   Show this help.

WARNING: You shouldn't run this command directly as a launchd job. Rather
you should write a small script that runs this command, and use launchd
to run that.
